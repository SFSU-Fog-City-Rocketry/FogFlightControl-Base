# FogFlightControl-Base

This is a very barebones frontend for the FogFlightControl project.

## Installation

To run the frontend, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal (Powershell on Windows, Terminal on macOS, ctrl+alt+t on Linux) and use the `cd` command to navigate to the folder where you want to download this code. We recommend using the Documents folder. Use `pwd` (print working directory) to print out the current folder and `ls` (list subdirectories) to see what folders are under your current location.
2. Once you're in the desired folder, execute the following command to clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/SFSU-Fog-City-Rocketry/FogFlightControl-Base.git

3. Navigate into the `react` folder where the frontend is located:

cd FogFlightControl-Base/react

4. Install the dependencies:

npm install

5. Start the frontend:

npm run dev

6. Point your web browser to `localhost:5173` to view the frontend.
